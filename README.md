# ARK Invest's Autonomous Taxi Price Per Mile Model
ARK estimates that, when autonomous taxi platforms proliferate, a ride in an autonomous taxi will cost consumers 26 cents per mile, less than half the cost of a personal car and less than one tenth the cost of a manually driven taxi. (See link to our blog post below) 

Posted here is ARK's model for the price per mile of an autonomous taxi. Please adjust with your own inputs and the price at which NPV=0 will adjust in cell C30. Alternatively, manually enter the price in cell C27 to see how the financials change below. We invite you to experiment and compare your assumptions to ours. As always, we will welcome your insights, thoughts, and feedback.
